# UI FOR ECLIPSE - SEPOLIA BRIDGE

An interface for the official Eclipse - Sepolia bridge. It has been coded to facilitate users and developers in using the Eclipse testnet bridge.

## How to use?

- Go to the [project page](https://hkey0.github.io/EclipseBridge/) served by Github pages.
- Connect with your Metamask wallet.
- Enter the amount you want to transfer in Ether and your eclipse wallet address. You can see the wallet address using the `solana address` command.
- Click on the "BRIDGE" button and confirm the transaction. The etherscan page will open in a new tab to follow the transaction.


## How to run it locally?

The HTML, CSS and Javascript code is executed by your browser, which means that when you download the files and open the index.html file in your browser, you will see something like the project page.

But metamask will not allow you to link to the index.html files. To connect with metamask you need to serve the html file with an http server. You can do this simply with a Visual Studio Code extension called [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
